  - Foxtail Millet (Kangni)
  - Little Millet (Kutki)
  - Kodo Millet
  - Barnyard Millet (Sanwa)

#### Features:

### 3. Enhanced Marketplace (`frontend/src/pages/Marketplace.js`)
**Changes Made:**
- Imported `getProductImage` utility
- Updated `CardMedia` component to display actual images
- Changed from `component="div"` to `component="img"`
- Added proper `alt` text for accessibility
- Set `objectFit: 'cover'` for consistent image sizing

**Before:**
```jsx
<CardMedia
  component="div"
  sx={{ height: 200, bgcolor: 'grey.200' }}
>
  <Typography>{product.name}</Typography>
</CardMedia>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<CardMedia
  component="img"
  height="200"
  image={getProductImage(product)}
  alt={product.name}
  sx={{ objectFit: 'cover', bgcolor: 'grey.200' }}
/>
```

### 4. Enhanced Product Detail Page (`frontend/src/pages/ProductDetail.js`)
**Complete Redesign:**
- Added full product details with image display
- Implemented proper API integration to fetch product data
- Enhanced layout with Material-UI Grid system
- Added features:
  - Large product image (400px height)
  - Product ratings display
  - Certifications section
  - Detailed product information
  - Add to Cart functionality
  - Loading and error states

### 5. Enhanced Crop Detail Page (`frontend/src/pages/CropDetail.js`)
**Complete Redesign:**
- Added full crop details with image display
- Implemented proper API integration to fetch crop data
- Enhanced layout similar to product detail page
- Added features:
  - Large crop image (400px height)
  - Crop location display with icon
  - Certifications section
  - Detailed crop information (sowing date, harvest date, quality)
  - Location details (village, district, state)
  - Traceability information
  - Place Order functionality
  - Loading and error states

## Image Sources

### Unsplash API
All images are sourced from Unsplash, which provides:
- ✅ Free to use for commercial projects
- ✅ High-quality professional photography
- ✅ No attribution required (though appreciated)
- ✅ Dynamic image resizing via URL parameters

### Image URL Format
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{id}?w=500&h=500&fit=crop
```

Parameters used:
- `w=500`: Width of 500px
- `h=500`: Height of 500px
- `fit=crop`: Crop to fit dimensions (maintains aspect ratio)

## How It Works

### Product Image Assignment
1. Check if product has custom `image`, `photo`, or `imageUrl` field
2. If not, get category from product
3. Use product name/ID to generate a hash
4. Select image from category array using hash (ensures same product always gets same image)
5. Return image URL

### Crop Image Assignment
1. Check if crop has custom `image`, `photo`, or `imageUrl` field
2. If not, get crop type and variety
3. Try to match crop type/variety with known millet types
4. Use crop identifier to generate hash
5. Select image from matched array using hash
6. Return image URL

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
1. **Image Upload**: Allow farmers/processors to upload their own product images
2. **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and progressive image loading
3. **Image Caching**: Use service workers to cache images for offline access
4. **Multiple Images**: Support image galleries with multiple photos per product

### Long Term
1. **CDN Integration**: Move images to a CDN for faster loading
2. **Image Processing**: Implement automatic image resizing and optimization
3. **AI Enhancement**: Use AI to improve image quality automatically
4. **360° View**: Add 360-degree product view capability
5. **Video Support**: Allow product demonstration videos

## Usage Examples

### Using Product Images in Components
```javascript
import { getProductImage } from '../utils/productImages';

// In your component
<img 
  src={getProductImage(product)} 
  alt={product.name}
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
/>
```

### Using Crop Images in Components
```javascript
import { getCropImage } from '../utils/cropImages';

// In your component
<img 
  src={getCropImage(crop)} 
  alt={`${crop.cropType} - ${crop.variety}`}
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
/>
```

### Preloading Images for Performance
```javascript
import { preloadProductImages } from '../utils/productImages';
import { preloadCropImages } from '../utils/cropImages';

// Preload images when data is fetched
useEffect(() => {
  if (products.length > 0) {
    preloadProductImages(products);
  }
}, [products]);
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to Marketplace page
- [ ] Verify all products display images (not gray boxes)
- [ ] Check that images load properly for all categories (Flour, Snacks, Cookies, Ready to Cook)
- [ ] Click on a product to view details
- [ ] Verify product detail page shows large image
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Check for broken image links
- [ ] Verify images maintain aspect ratio
- [ ] Test crop detail page similarly

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome ✅
- Firefox ✅
- Safari ✅
- Edge ✅
- Mobile browsers ✅

## Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
- All images are requested at 500x500px (optimal for cards)
- Unsplash automatically optimizes and serves images
- Images are served via CDN (Unsplash's infrastructure)
- Browser caching is enabled by default

### Loading Strategy
- Images load as part of normal page render
- Gray background shown while images load
- `objectFit: 'cover'` ensures images never distort
- Optional: Implement lazy loading for better initial page load

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Unsplash URLs are accessible
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure `getProductImage` or `getCropImage` is imported correctly

### Wrong Images Displayed
1. Verify product category is set correctly
2. Check if product has custom image field
3. Review hash function logic in utilities

### Performance Issues
1. Implement lazy loading
2. Consider reducing image dimensions
3. Add loading="lazy" attribute
4. Implement progressive image loading
